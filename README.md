# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project uses PYTHON(FLASK AND JINJA), JAVASCRIPT, HTML, SCSS, POSTGRESQL and a third party API called GOODREADS.

In this project, a user is allowed to register in our database and then login into their account. From there, a user can search a book. There, a search box will display which searches for title/author/isbn code of book and displays results accordingly. Further, from the search results, a user can review the book. If user has already reviewed the book, then he will not be allowed to do the same again. But is not, the user can submit his/her review and rating on the book. Moreover, the website has an API which returns the book information on the basis of the isbn number.

The user can also view the reviews and ratings which other people have given on a book on the same website.

Finally, a user can logout.
